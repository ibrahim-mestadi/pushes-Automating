# pushes-Automating 
A bash Script to automat pushs with one command

## Why this Script

Instead of typing same git commands to push file on to github repository, which makes me angry sometimes during working on projects, I decided to automate this process to impove productivity.

## Process to integrate :

* First : **change the file premession & make it executable** by using 
```sh
chmod +x auto-push.sh
```
* Second :  Now the script is executable we need copy it to a directory that in our system expects to contain executable scripts and code. I'm the only user of my system so I'll copy the script to /usr/bin, with : 
```sh
sudo cp auto-push.sh /usr/bin/auto-push.sh
```

* Third : There is no third step the system recognize the script use it & ***Happy codding*** ðŸ˜Š
